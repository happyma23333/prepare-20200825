The two graphs provide information between 1980 and 2000. The first chart gives information about the change of the ozone hole size in Antarctic, while the second chart illustrates the amount of three types of damaging gases jeopardizing the Antarctic Area. 



In 1980, the size of Antarctic Ozone Hole was only 40,000 square kilometers approximately. After growing up to 80 in 1985, the figure rose dramatically to 190 in the next five years. However, this trend slowed down in the next decade, as the figure reached 230 in 2000.
