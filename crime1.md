1 Some people think that lawbreakers should be sent to prison. However, others think that better talents among those should be made to work. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.



**Incarceration** as a form of criminal **punishment** has **become widespread around** the world in the last few centuries. I think that imprison is an effective way to punishing **wrongdoers** and there is no reason consider other approaches.



People who have broken laws should be sent into prison. Even if some criminals **have outstanding talents in some certain fields**, it does not mean that they can **be exempt from** **harsh punishment**, especially those who **commit serious crime**. **Depriving** prisoners **of freedom** can act as a **deterrent** for other would-be offenders who may think twice before making wrong decisions.



Allowing  **convicted felons** to work rather than locking them up does **offer some potential advantages**, such as providing them with an opportunity to **make positive contribution**. For instance, those who are well-educated can be made to **do work in their fields of expertise**, which is a far more meaningful way to **pay their debt to society**. Moreover, 



In my opinion, laws are in place to **maintain social order and justice**. It seems **discriminatory and irresponsible** to treat criminal differently based on their ability or educational background. In addition, it sends the wrong message to aspired criminals, indicating that they can have little fear from the justice system as they will never receive a prison sentence.
