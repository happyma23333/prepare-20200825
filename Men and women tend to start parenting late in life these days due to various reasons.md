Men and women tend to start parenting late in life these days due to various reasons. I think this development is negative to a large extent despite some positive impacts.



**One of the most prominent reasons** is the high cost of raising a child. In order to **provide a well-rounded education** to a child these days, the spending never ends. The money spent on general education and medicine may just be a small part compared to other costs, such as **fees for attending extracurricular activities**, academic tutoring such as oversea travel expenses, will quickly add up. Due to such **heavy financial pressure**, it is understandable that couple choose to wait until middle age. In addition, some women seek more education to establish themselves in jobs and careers. They simply expect to be **financially independent** before having their children, which is a clear incentive for delaying.



Although late birth can **slow down the growth of population** and **enable parents to offer a better living condition for their offspring**, this phenomenon has negative impacts in many aspects. A direct influence is the increase of aging population which lead to **a shortage of workforce**. Furthermore, the financial burden of taking care of the elderly will be a problem for both the government and young adults. Form the perspective of health and safety, women may suffer from high-risk pregnancy if they choose to have a child in their 40s or at an older age.



In conclusion, financial factors mainly contribute to oder parenthood. This trend will bring more negative influences to a family and the society in the long run.
