Nowadays, most countries improve the standard of living through economic development. But some social values are lost as a result. Do you think the advantages of the phenomenon outweigh the disadvantages? 



Nowadays, it is a common phenomenon that economic development in many countries has resulted in a negative change to social values. In my option, the disadvantage of value degradation outweigh the positives brought by economic growth.



Admittedly, increased economic development has improved people's lives drastically. People now have more disposable income that at any point during history which has given them the freedom to follow their passions. For example, the rise of niche hobbies can be attribute to people having more economic freedom. However, this has come at cost. For instance, clothes in good condition are now disposed of for people to pursue the latest fashion design, as the virtue of frugality is seen as a negative with society because people now trend towards materialism. I believe, this shows economic prosperity does not outweigh the loss of social values.



In regard to social values, a lack of good values has created a cruel and hostile environment in some parts of the world, which has led to increased crime and chaos. The USA, for example, is seeing record incarceration rates, which is also undoing some of the achievements of the economic growth. Moreover, the focus on economic development has also led to a lack of social awareness for protecting the environment and endangered animals in the name of making money. Lastly, others tend to be less friendly towards others as they find it unnecessary to offer help as they pursue economic development over building community bonds. Overall, these examples show the enormous impact that the loss of values is having on society.



To conclude, economic development has helped increased the standard of living and has given people more freedom. However, I believe this is vastly outweighed by the loss of social values which has helped contribute towards increased crime and environment erosion.
