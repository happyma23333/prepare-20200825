lecture vs technology

Lectures were used to be a way to teach large number of students, but with the technology available for education, there is no longer justification for lectures. To what extent do you agree or disagree？



Online classes have become widespread around the world these years. I think that technologies have made education, but traditional lectures can not be substituted.

Students are receiving better education with the help of technologies. Distance learning has made it possible for those who cannot go to their dream school because of graphical limitation to study in their desired field. There are still some students living in the countries with poor education, so it would be difficult for them to learn well if they are not willing to leave their countries. However, they will able to obtain online courses from outstanding universities or even obtaining qualifications if permitted through network. Also, for those workers who are willing to earn degrees, taking courses online will allow them to view video lessons on school's website whenever they want.

Universities and colleges are now **offering qualifications** through distance learning from the Internet rather than teachers in the classroom. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages

Although I understand the advantage of distance learning, I maintain that the disadvantages may **have more impact on** the learning process than the advantages in some cases.

Not all people live near colleges or universities that offer courses in their desired field of study. With this in mind, online learning can eliminate geographical limitations in education. Also, some students who are willing to earn degrees are working full time, so they might not have a schedule which is flexible enough to allow for traditional classroom learning. If they take classes online, they will be able to study after work or during weekends. Besides, learning materials and instruction can actually be obtained online at any time. For instance, most distance learning program allow students to view video lessons on the school's website whenever they have time for it.

Nonetheless, the disadvantage should not be ignored. First, the lack of social interaction may affect the efficiency of learning. For those who need immediate assistance on academic studies, they will receive a timely response in the classroom rather than wait for 24 hours or longer till their teachers have time to reply through email. Group discussions or group projects may heavily rely on emails or phone calls, which could lead to misunderstanding due to insufficient communication. Second, students may not be as strictly supervised as those attending offline courses. As a result, those who are less disciplined would probably fail to keep track of their course work and assignments, thus cramming for exams on the very last of day.



In conclusion, although distance learning is known for flexibility, it does not necessarily suit all types of students. It is generally a poor option for students who are less-motivated or are not used to communicating through emails or other forms of e-communication.
